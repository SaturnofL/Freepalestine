        <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
        <p> Free Palestine’s mission is to bring awareness to the Palestine vs Israel events that are currently going on in the world. We wish to inform the uninformed and create funding for the people of Palestine, because we’re all for helping those who are oppressed be free.  </p>
