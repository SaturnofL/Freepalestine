    <h2> Late 1900s</h2>
    <p> The conflict between Palestine and Israel began back in the 1940s when Israel first began to form. Great Britain pulled out of Palestine and the United Nations decided to divide the land into Arab and Jewish states. Palestinians were against this happening because their land was being taken from them and despite making up a less percentage of the population, Jewish people were given a bigger portion of the land. So the newly formed State of Israel had more land than the other two territories; The West Bank and the Gaza Strip. War broke out during these times and 750,000 Palestinians ended up displaced afterwards.</p>
